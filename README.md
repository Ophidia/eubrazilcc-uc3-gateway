# pdas-scientific-gateway

Eubrazil Scientific Gateway integrates tools to understand how biodiversity (and its ecosystems) is buffering climate change and may reduce negative and/or negative effects of climate change. Workflows will combine the analysis of data acquired with different technologies, such as LiDAR, hyper-spectral imagery, satellite images and ground level sensors, with meteorological and biodiversity data to study the impact of climate change in regions with high interest for biodiversity conservation.
